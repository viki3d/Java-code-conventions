# Java code conventions

## Reasons to adopt code convention 
* Maintaining unified code style
* Improving software readability
* Speeding up the work
* Hardly any software is maintained for its whole life by the original author

## The most important conventions
* Oracle Code Conventions for the Java (1999).  
  [Code Conventions for the Java TM Programming Language](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/codeconventions-contents.html).
  
  Oracleâ€™s Code Convention is the most important, since it is the official and
  most used convention.

  > Q: 1999?  
  A: Yes, the wheel have already been invented!  

  > Q: Any updates?  
  A: Unfortunatelly - no. After Java 8 has been released the new features, like
  lambdas and streams are missing in the classic convention. Google stepped in
  here by altering some of the classic conventions and cover these new features too.
  
* Google Java Style Guide (2018).

  > Google's convetions are important because Google is a tech giant and developed 
  tons of Java applications. Also, Google covered the new Java features.

## Companies specific code conventions
Many companies have their own code conventions. So the developers should be able to switch into any code convention required.
Here are a few examples for specific Java conventions in different companies.
